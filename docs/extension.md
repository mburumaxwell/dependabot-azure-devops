# Using the extension

See the extension [README.md](../extension/README.md).

# Development guide

## Getting the development environment ready
First, ensure you have [Node.js](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) v18+ installed.
Next, install project dependencies with npm:

```bash
cd extension
npm install
```

## Building the extension
```bash
cd extension
npm run build:prod
npm run mv:prod
```

To generate the  Azure DevOps `.vsix` extension package for testing, you'll first need to [create a publisher account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?view=azure-devops#create-a-publisher) on the [Visual Studio Marketplace Publishing Portal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/createpublisher?managePageRedirect=true). After this, override your publisher ID below and generate the extension with:

```bash
npx tfx-cli extension create --overrides-file overrides.local.json --override "{\"publisher\": \"your-publisher-id-here\"}" --json5
```

## Installing the extension
To test the extension in Azure DevOps, you'll first need to build the extension `.vsix` file (see above). After this, [publish your extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?view=azure-devops#publish-your-extension), then [install your extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?view=azure-devops#install-your-extension).

## Running the unit tests
```bash
cd extension
npm run test
```
