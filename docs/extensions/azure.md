# Using the extension

Refer to the extension [README.md](../extensions/azure/README.md).

# Troubleshooting issues

Dependabot will log more diagnostic information when [verbose logs are enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/troubleshooting/review-logs?view=azure-devops&tabs=windows-agent#configure-verbose-logs); i.e. `System.Debug` variable is set to `true`.

When verbose logs are enable, Dependabot will also generate a [Flame Graph performance metrics report](https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html), which can be viewed by [downloading the pipeline logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/troubleshooting/review-logs?view=azure-devops&tabs=windows-agent#view-and-download-logs), then locating the corresponding HTML report file in the `Job` folder. To understand how to read Flame Graph reports, see: <https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html#summary>

> [!WARNING]
> When sharing pipeline logs, please be aware that the **task log contains potentially sensitive information** such as your DevOps organisation name, project names, repository names, private package feeds URLs, list of used dependency names/versions, and the contents of any dependency files that are updated (e.g. `package.json`, `*.csproj`, etc). The Flame Graph report does **not** contain any sensitive information about your DevOps environment.

> [!TIP]
> To mask environment secrets from the task log, set the `System.Secrets` variable to `true` in your pipeline.

# Development guide

## Getting the development environment ready

Install [Node.js](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (22+), [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.22+), and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (with Linux containers); Install project dependencies using PNPM:

```bash
cd extension
pnpm install
```

## Building the extension

```bash
cd extension
pnpm build
```

To then generate the a Azure DevOps `.vsix` extension package for testing, you'll first need to [create a publisher account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?view=azure-devops#create-a-publisher) for the [Visual Studio Marketplace Publishing Portal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/createpublisher?managePageRedirect=true). After this, use `pnpm package` to build the package, with an override for your publisher ID:

```bash
pnpm package -- --overrides-file overrides.local.json --rev-version --publisher your-publisher-id-here
```

## Installing the extension

To test the extension in a Azure DevOps organisation:

1. [Build the extension `.vsix` package](#building-the-extension)
2. [Publish the extension to your publisher account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?view=azure-devops#publish-your-extension)
3. [Share the extension with the organisation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?view=azure-devops#share-your-extension).

## Running the task locally

To run the latest task version:

```bash
pnpm start
```

To run a specific task version:

```bash
pnpm start:V1 # runs dependabot@1 task
pnpm start:V2 # runs dependabot@2 task
```

## Running the unit tests

```bash
cd extension
pnpm test
```

## dependabot2 versioned update process diagram

High-level sequence diagram illustrating how the `dependabot@2` task performs versioned updates using [dependabot-cli](https://github.com/dependabot/cli). For more technical details, see [how dependabot-cli works](https://github.com/dependabot/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works).

      end
    end

## dependabot2 security-only update process diagram

High-level sequence diagram illustrating how the `dependabot@2` task performs security-only updates using [dependabot-cli](https://github.com/dependabot/cli).

```mermaid
 sequenceDiagram
    participant ext as TaskV2
    participant cli as Dependabot CLI
    participant gha as GitHub Advisory Database

    ext->>ext: Write `list-dependencies-job.yml`
    Note right of ext: The job file contains `ignore: [ 'dependency-name': '*' ]`.<br>This will make Dependabot to discover all dependencies, but not update anything.<br>We can then extract the dependency list from the "depenedency_list" output.
    ext->>+cli: Execute `dependabot update -f list-dependencies-job.yml -o output.yml`
    cli->>cli: Run update job
    cli->>cli: Write `output.yaml`
    cli-->>-ext: Update completed

    ext->>ext: Read and parse `output.yaml`, extract "dependency_list"
    loop for each dependency
      ext->>gha: Check security advisories for dependency
    end
    ext->>ext: Filter dependency list to only ones containing security advisories
    ext->>ext: Write `security-only-update-job.yml`
    Note right of ext: The job file contains the list of `dependency-names` and `security-advisories`.<br>This will make Dependanbot only update the dependencies named in the job file.
    ext->>+cli: Execute `dependabot update -f security-only-update-job-job.yml -o output.yml`
    cli->>cli: Run update job
    cli->>cli: Write `output.yaml`
    cli-->>-ext: Update completed
    ext->>ext: Read and parse `output.yaml`
    Note right of ext: Normal update logic resumes from this point.<br/>Outputs are parsed, pull requests are created/updated/closed based on the outputs
```
