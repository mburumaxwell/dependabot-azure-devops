Welcome to [paklo.app](/) (the "Site"), hosted by Paklo ("Paklo",
"we", "us", and/or "our"). Paklo provides a hosted service for dependency
update automation (the "Services"). We value your privacy and are
dedicated to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy covers how we
collect, handle, and disclose personal data on our Platform.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy,
our data practices, or would like to exercise your rights, do not hesitate to
contact us.

## To Whom Does This Policy Apply

This Privacy Policy applies to customers and site visitors. Each customer is
responsible for posting its own terms, conditions, and privacy policies, and
ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, as our Platform and our
business may change. Your continued use of the Platform after any changes to
this Privacy Policy indicates your agreement with the terms of the revised
Privacy Policy.

## What Information Do We Collect

We collect information in three main ways:

- **Information you provide**: name, email address, organization details,
support requests, and any information you send us directly.
- **Account, billing, and usage information**: subscription status and billing
details handled by our payment provider, plus Service usage data (for example,
configured projects, settings, and usage needed for limits/overages).
- **Repository and integration data (when you connect an integration)**:
metadata needed to provide the Services (for example, repository identifiers,
dependency manifests/configuration, and update/PR status). We aim to minimise
what we store and only process what is required to operate the Services.
- **Technical data**: basic logs such as IP address, device/browser
information, and error/diagnostic events for security and reliability.

## Cookies

We may use essential cookies or similar technologies for sign-in, security,
and core site functionality. We do not use advertising cookies.

## How we use information

We use personal data to:

- provide and operate the Services (including integrations you authorise)
- authenticate users and prevent fraud/abuse
- maintain, secure, and improve the Services
- communicate with you about the Services (including support and important
notices)
- comply with legal obligations

## How we share information

We share personal data only as needed to run Paklo:

- **Service providers** (for example hosting, database, email delivery,
payments, monitoring), acting as processors/subprocessors
- **Integration partners** you connect (for example, your code hosting
platform), as part of providing the Services you request
- **Legal/safety** reasons (to comply with law, enforce terms, or protect
rights and security)

We do not sell personal data.

## Data retention

We keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described
above, including providing the Services, meeting legal/accounting obligations,
and maintaining security logs. Retention periods may vary by data type.

## Your rights

Depending on where you live (including the UK/EU), you may have rights to
access, correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal data,
and to object or request portability.
To make a request, contact <support@paklo.app>.

## Security

We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect personal
data. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.

## International transfers

Our service providers may process data in countries outside your country of
residence. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for such transfers.
