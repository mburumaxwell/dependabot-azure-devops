#
# This module overrides the dependabot-core nuget.config credential helper with our own implementation that fixes:
#  - https://github.com/tinglesoftware/dependabot-azure-devops/issues/1243
#
# Without this override, updates via MSBuild/NuGet.exe to .NET Framework projects (i.e. packages.config projects)
# fail to authenticate with private NuGet feeds when:
#  - The NuGet feed is hosted in Azure DevOps; The password is invalid if token notation is "PAT:12345"
#  - The NuGet feed is secured with basic auth (e.g. nuget.telerik.com); The username was hardcoded to "user"
#  - The source repository already contains a nuget.config file; All feed config and package source mappings are ignored
#
# This module primarily fixes auth in .NET Framework projects; .NET [Core] projects auth is handled differently.
# See: tinglesoftware/azure/artifacts_credential_provider.rb for more info.
#
# This credential provider is required for ALL private NuGet feeds, even if they are not hosted in Azure DevOps.
# See README.md (Credentials for private registries and feeds) for more details.
#

# TODO: Remove this once https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/pull/8927 is resolved or auth works natively.
