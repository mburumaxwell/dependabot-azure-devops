Add tool usage tracking.
The information collected is shown in the logs at the end of each job.

This is to help me understand the usage of the tool/extension/cli through a couple of weeks. There is no other source of this information except for when reviews are left but no-one is bothered to leave those or to even want to give feedback via other channels.
Do people still use this? Let's find out.
