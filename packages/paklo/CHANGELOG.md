## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 464b287: Add support for running with Docker directly instead of through dependabot-cli
- 6eedcd0: Add support for cleaning up old images, containers or networks
- 98b0674: Update job config schema to make certain fields required. The dependabot-cli used to fill this automatically but without it, we need to add them
- 47549f4: Add jobs runner that contains most logic from run command
- e552f59: Replace axios with inbuilt fetch
- b8c85fd: Allow selection of target update ids in the CLI
- 81eed7e: Replicate output processor functionality into a local server bridging Azure DevOps and dependabot
- 50ab5c7: Skip authentication of job token if the request is HTTP because the proxy will have omitted it
- 544fca1: Convert extension task to no longer use dependabot CLI
- 5fe3503: Support security only updates in CLI
- 16b1cb6: Added ApiClient which sits in between the runner and the API
  This gets the CLI and shared package at par with github/dependabot-action clearing the way for migrating the v2 task and for managed runs later.
- 058603b: Replace azure-devops-node-api with native fetch calls
- 99dd824: Change job id values to be numbers generated randomly by default
