# Dependabot Azure DevOps Extension

This is the unofficial [dependabot](https://github.com/Dependabot/dependabot-core) extension for [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/). It will allow you to run Dependabot inside a build pipeline.

## Usage

Add a configuration file stored at `.azuredevops/dependabot.yml` or `.github/dependabot.yml` conforming to the [official spec](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates).

To use in a YAML pipeline:

```yaml
- task: dependabot@2
```

You can schedule the pipeline as is appropriate for your solution.

An example of a YAML pipeline:

```yaml
trigger: none # Disable CI trigger

schedules:
- cron: '0 2 * * *' # daily at 2am UTC
  always: true # run even when there are no code changes
  branches:
    include:
      - master
  batch: true
  displayName: Daily

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest' # requires macos or ubuntu (windows is not supported)

steps:
- task: dependabot@2
```

## Task Requirements

The task uses [dependabot-cli](https://github.com/dependabot/cli), which requires [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.22+) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (with Linux containers) be installed on the pipeline agent.
If you use [Microsoft-hosted agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#software), we recommend using the [ubuntu-latest](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2404-Readme.md) image, which meets all task requirements.

Dependabot uses Docker containers, which may take time to install if not already cached. Subsequent dependabot tasks in the same job will be faster after initially pulling the images. An alternative way to run your pipelines faster is by leveraging Docker caching in Azure Pipelines (See [#113](https://github.com/tinglesoftware/dependabot-azure-devops/issues/113#issuecomment-894771611)).

|Input|Description|
|--|--|
|skipPullRequests|**_Optional_**. Determines whether to skip creation and updating of pull requests. When set to `true` the logic to update the dependencies is executed but the actual Pull Requests are not created/updated. This is useful for debugging. Defaults to `false`.|
|abandonUnwantedPullRequests|**_Optional_**. Determines whether to abandon unwanted pull requests. Defaults to `false`.|
|commentPullRequests|**_Optional_**. Determines whether to comment on pull requests which an explanation of the reason for closing. Defaults to `false`.|
|setAutoComplete|**_Optional_**. Determines if the pull requests that dependabot creates should have auto complete set. When set to `true`, pull requests that pass all policies will be merged automatically. Defaults to `false`.|
|mergeStrategy|**_Optional_**. The merge strategy to use when auto complete is set. Learn more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/git/pull-requests/update?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0&tabs=HTTP#gitpullrequestmergestrategy). Defaults to `squash`.|
|autoCompleteIgnoreConfigIds|**_Optional_**. List of any policy configuration Id's which auto-complete should not wait for. Only applies to optional policies. Auto-complete always waits for required (blocking) policies.|
|autoApprove|**_Optional_**. Determines if the pull requests that dependabot creates should be automatically completed. When set to `true`, pull requests will be approved automatically. To use a different user for approval, supply `autoApproveUserToken` input. Defaults to `false`.|
|autoApproveUserToken|**_Optional_**. A personal access token for the user to automatically approve the created PR.|
|authorEmail|**_Optional_**. The email address to use for the change commit author. Can be used to associate the committer with an existing account, to provide a profile picture. Defaults to `noreply@github.com`.|
|authorName|**_Optional_**. The name to use as the git commit author of the pull requests. Defaults to `dependabot[bot]`.|
|securityAdvisoriesFile|**_Optional_**. The path to a JSON file containing additional security advisories to be included when performing package updates.

|azureDevOpsServiceConnection|**_Optional_**. A Service Connection to use for accessing Azure DevOps. Supply a value here to avoid using permissions for the Build Service either because you cannot change its permissions or because you prefer that the Pull Requests be done by a different user. When not provided, the current authentication scope is used.<br/>See the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops) to know more about creating a Service Connections|
|azureDevOpsAccessToken|**_Optional_**. The Personal Access Token for accessing Azure DevOps. Supply a value here to avoid using permissions for the Build Service either because you cannot change its permissions or because you prefer that the Pull Requests be done by a different user. When not provided, the current authentication scope is used. In either case, be use the following permissions are granted: <br/>-&nbsp;Code (Full)<br/>-&nbsp;Pull Requests Threads (Read & Write).<br/>See the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page#create-a-pat) to know more about creating a Personal Access Token.<br/>Use this in place of `azureDevOpsServiceConnection` such as when it is not possible to create a service connection.|
|gitHubConnection|**_Optional_**. The GitHub service connection for authenticating requests against GitHub repositories. This is useful to avoid rate limiting errors.

|storeDependencyList|**_Optional_**. Determines if the last know dependency list information should be stored in the parent DevOps project properties. If enabled, the authenticated user must have the "Project & Team (Write)" permission for the project. Enabling this option improves performance when doing security-only updates. Defaults to `false`.|
|targetRepositoryName|**_Optional_**. The name of the repository to target for processing. If this value is not supplied then the Build Repository Name is used. Supplying this value allows creation of a single pipeline that runs Dependabot against multiple repositories by running a `dependabot` task for each repository to update.|
|targetUpdateIds|**_Optional_**. A semicolon (`;`) delimited list of update identifiers run. Index are zero-based and in the order written in the configuration file. When not present, all the updates are run. This is meant to be used in scenarios where you want to run updates a different times from the same configuration file given you cannot schedule them independently in the pipeline.|
|experiments|**_Optional_**. Comma separated list of Dependabot experiments; available options depend on the ecosystem. Example: `tidy=true,vendor=true,goprivate=*`. See: [Configuring experiments](https://github.com/tinglesoftware/dependabot-azure-devops/#configuring-experiments)|
